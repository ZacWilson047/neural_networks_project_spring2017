What follows is a brief description of the files in this repository. After downloading the IAM database, the first script to by run is label_repr.py, which reads all of the target label sequence files, and determines which characters are present in all of the target label sequences. These characters are put in a list, sorted alphanumerically, and serialized. Subsequently, label sequences are represented as lists of integers, where each integer is the index of the label character in the serialized characters file. This “output label sequences as lists of integers” representation is required by the TensorFlow CTC framework. The next script that is run is data_gen.py, which reads all of the raw IAM handwriting data and writes out serialized dictionaries containing the parsed data instances that are used to train, validate, and test the network. Finally, handwriting_classifier.py contains the code for the ultimate CTC network that attempt to perform online handwriting recognition on the IAM dataset. The repository also contains a sample raw data file from the IAM database, a sample serialized training instance, sample output from the networks, and a CTC network trained on the MNIST dataset.
